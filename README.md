![](https://github.com/mr0406/modular-restaurant/actions/workflows/dotnet.yml/badge.svg)

## Introduction
Modular Restaurant is an open source project written in .NET 5.0.\
The idea behind this repository is to write a real application related to the restaurant domain.  

We are going to use concepts like: 
  - Modular monolith
  - CQRS
  - DDD
  - Event storming

The main purpose of that project is to try new software design ideas and become better software developers.

## Architecture
The modular monolith was chosen as the project's architecture. The whole project idea is based on that concept.
The idea is to have independent modules and some shared concepts stored in one solution.

Modules will be written using DDD and Clean Architecture.
